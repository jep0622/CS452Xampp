Instructions:

Download xampp from https://www.apachefriends.org/

In the xampp control panel, ensure the Apache and MySQL services are downloaded (click the checkmarks next to them).

While in the control panel, open the config file of MySQL (my.ini). Set port to 3307 (default is 3306)

Find the config.inc.php file in xampp > phpMyAdmin. You'll find the following line early in the file:
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = true;

Add this line directly beneath it to change the port
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['port'] = 3307;

Back to the control panel, start Apache and MySQL servers. Click admin on MySQL to open phpmyadmin.
Make a new database named "athensdb". 
Import the sql file provided in the github (github.com/jep0622/CS452Xampp) to create the tables in the database.

In xampp > htdocs make a new folder, name it whatever you want the site folder to be named, for example siteFolder.
Download all files from the github and place them directly into the siteFolder.
(The sql file and this instructional text file do absolutely nothing here but they don't hurt)

Open any browser. Navigate to localhost/siteFolder (or whatever you named the folder)
